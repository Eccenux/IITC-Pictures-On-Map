# IITC-Pictures-On-Map
Makes it easier to view the portal pictures in an area


## Description
This is an IITC plugin that makes it easier to browse the photos of multiple portals in an area  

* Ingress - a mobile game developed by Niantic
* Intel Map - intel.ingress.com , the official online map of the world of Ingress
* Portals - Ingress points-of-interest (known as pokestops/pokegyms in Pokemon GO)
* IITC - a community-created extension of the Intel Map; it supports a Javascript-based plugin system; this plugin is written for the IITC-CE version (https://iitc.app/)  


## Installing
If you have IITC installed, simply clicking on https://github.com/san00shine/IITC-Pictures-On-Map/raw/main/iitc-pictures-on-map.user.js should install the plugin on dekstop browsers. The plugin has not been tested on mobiles.  


## What does it do?

**Note:** The plugin will only work when the full portal details are loaded - which means **you need to be at a zoom level where all portals are displayed**!  

### 1. Show a thumbnail of portal pictures for all portals with loaded details on map

### 2. Display portal pictures in the Portals List

You need the "Portals List" plugin (https://iitc.app/download_desktop.html#portals-list_bqy_teo96_release) for this to work.

### 3. Open the full-size portal photo when clicking on the dialog that opens when clicking the photo from the portal details panel

## Data Traffic

This plugin only uses information already available on the Intel page, it generates no additional requests to the Niantic servers.
It does, however, generate traffic to the Google servers that host the images, so watch your data if you are on a metered connection!
