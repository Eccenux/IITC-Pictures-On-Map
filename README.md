# IITC-Pictures-On-Map

Makes it easier to view the portal pictures in an area.

Note! This plugin puts heavy load on your network. Don't enable pictures layer unless you need to.

## Installing

Assuming you already have IITC just &rarr; **[install the script](https://github.com/Eccenux/IITC-Pictures-On-Map/raw/main/iitc-pictures-on-map.user.js)**.


## What does it do?

**Note:** The plugin will only work when the full portal details are loaded - which means **you need to be at a zoom level where all portals are displayed**!  

### 1. Show a thumbnail of portal pictures for all portals with loaded details on map

### 2. Display portal pictures in the Portals List

You will need the [Show List Of Portals plugin](https://iitc.me/desktop/#plugin-portals-list) for this to work.

### 3. Open the full-size portal photo when clicking on the dialog that opens when clicking the photo from the portal details panel

## Data Traffic

This plugin only uses information already available on the Intel page, it generates no additional requests to the Niantic servers.
It does, however, generate traffic to the Google servers that host the images, so watch your data if you are on a metered connection!
